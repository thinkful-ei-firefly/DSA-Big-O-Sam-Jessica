1. What is the Big O for this?
1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

A: Constant time - regardless of the number of people in the room, all are being queried at the same time, so the time complexity does not increase with number of people.

2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

A: Linear time - the number of requests made increases directly proportionally to the number of people in the room.

2. Even or odd
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else
        return false;
    }
}

A: Contant time - regardless of the size of the number, only one operation is being performed.

3. Are you here?
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function areYouHere(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        const el1 = arr1[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const el2 = arr2[j];
            if (el1 === el2) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

A: The time complexity of this algorithm is polyunomial time, i*j, where i is the length of array1 and j is the length of array2. This is due to the nested loops, which iterates j times over each iteration of i.

4. Doubler
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}

A: Linear time - it operates on every entry of an array and increases at a 1:1 ratio of operations: array length.

5. Naive search
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}

A: Again, linear time, since the operation is performed once on every element of an array.

6. Creating pairs:
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function createPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i] + ", " +  arr[j] );
        }
    }
}

A: Polynomial time of i^2, where i is the length of the array. This is due to the nested for loops.

7. Compute the sequence
What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i == 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

A: This is a linear-time operation that generates an array of length (num) containing the first (num) values of the Fibonacci sequence. It is linear time due to the linear nature of the iteration.

8. An efficient search
In this example, we return to the problem of searching using a more sophisticated approach than in naive search, above. Assume that the input array is always sorted. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function efficientSearch(array, item) {
    let minIndex = 0;
    let maxIndex = array.length - 1;
    let currentIndex;
    let currentElement;

    while (minIndex <= maxIndex) {
        currentIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
        currentElement = array[currentIndex];

        if (currentElement < item) {
            minIndex = currentIndex + 1;
        }
        else if (currentElement > item) {
            maxIndex = currentIndex - 1;
        }
        else {
            return currentIndex;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

A: Assuming that the array is always sorted, this algorithm uses logarithmic time by cutting the array in half each iteration, thereby reducing the number of iterations required to find a matching value.

9. Random element
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}

A: This is contant time - it returns one randomly-chosen array element regardless of the array's length.

10. What Am I?
What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isWhat(n) {
    if (n < 2 || n % 1 != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

A: This algorithm will return true if the given value n is a prime number, and will return false otherwise. This is linear in complexity; the operation will be performed a maximum of n times regardless of the value of n.

11. Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a very famous mathematical puzzle (some call it game!). This is how it goes:

There are three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest disk at the top (making a conical shape). The other two rods are empty to begin with.
The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of rods to another rod (can't be the original rod where it was stacked before) where it will be stacked in the ascending order as well. This should be done obeying the following rules: i) Only one disk may be moved at a time ii) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod. iii) A larger disk may not placed on top of a smaller disk
Input:

Rod A	Rod B	Rod C
----		
---------		
-------------		
Output:

Rod A	Rod B	Rod C
----
---------
-------------
Derive an algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
Implement your algorithm using recursion. Your program should display each movement of the disk from one rod to another.
If you are given 5 disks, how do the rods look like after 7 recursive calls?
How many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 3 disks? with 4 disks? with 5 disks?
What is the runtime of your algorithm?
